# Untappd

This is my version of the website "untappd".  Users are able to sign up, log in and log out to log beer reviews.  Each review is complete with the name of the beer, name of the brewery, rating and any additional comments the user may want to add. Logging in allows you access to see all the reviews by every user, and it also allows you to update or delete any review that you've created. 

This was created using a mix of Javascript, React, Redux, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and Express.
